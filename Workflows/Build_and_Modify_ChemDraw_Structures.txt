========================
Building the Structure
========================

When possible, use 

    Structure > Convert Name to Structure

These compounds are all pretty common, so are likely to be in their
structure library. 

Save it as a regular ChemDraw file.

Also select the structure and use:

    ctrl-alt-C

    ...to copy the structure as SMILES

    and paste that into Notepad or such (and save)

Here is one way to get a 3D strucure from that:

    View > Show Chem3D Hotlink Window

    In the window that pops up, click the icon at lower left.
    On hover, it should say "Launch Chem3D"

    From the Chem3D Window, 

        File > Save Copy As 

        Save it as a Mol2 file.  


Finally, copy the chemdraw file, the mol2 file and the
file containing the SMILES over to the ChemDraw Structures
folder in the repo.


========================
Modifying the Structure
========================

The structure that is generated must be altered and made into
a PDB file.

If you saved a file 'Structure.mol2' earlier, and if you take a
look inside, you will find that the residue name is composed of
stars.  

To fix these issues, cd to the ChemDraw Structures folder and 
issue a command equivalent to:

bash ../0_Scripts/convert_checmdraw3D_and_set_residue_name.bash Structure.mol2 Structure.pdb ZZZ

Here, your residue will be named 'ZZZ'.  You can change that
to something else if you prefer.
