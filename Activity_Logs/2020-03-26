For the last hour and a half, I've been working on the organization of
the information in this repository, on building the organizational
structure (directories) and adding some README docs and such.

11:35

My next task is to go all the way through my workflow once and document
the process as I go.  After that, I will go through the process again, 
trying to follow my documented procedure.  I will refine the documentation
as needed.

For my first documentation pass, I will try to insert lavandulyl acetate 
into the binding site of the main protease.  I choose the main protease 
because of the project described within this post:

I choose lavandulyl acetate because (1) I like lavender and (2) it is 
one of the main components in my homemade asthma reliever..

I will periodically run ispell on these work notes.

The group mentioned in the post above provide a structure of the apo form
of the main protease.  I believe that the corresponding entry at rcsb.org
is PDB ID 6LU7.  It is called '6YB7', but that is not a PDB ID.

First, I will compare the two and reassure myself that they are equivalent
structures.  I will store the results as a VMD visualization state.
