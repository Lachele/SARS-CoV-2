I cannot focus on this - or anything - as I would like.  So... if you're
reading this and want to jump in or get an idea and run with it, go for it.

I want to get all the way through a minimization before working out details
for the entire protocol.  

First, I need to work out which residues will be closest, near and far.  This
is a non-trivial exercise.  The problem is that I need to figure out what is
the binding site - not merely what is near the ligand. 

No better time to start than now.

First possible list of "closest" includes these and some in between:

NOTE:  Residue numbers are as listed in the parm7/rst7 files and 
not the original numbers in the PDB file.  I'll have to translate 
back later.

After visually inspecting the binding site, I decided that these residues
are the ones that directly form the 'skin' of the binding site:

resid 19 to 23 34 to 42 44 to 46 48 50 114 115 136 to 142 158 to 173 177 to 179 181 to 188

The next layer out will have to wait until tomorrow.
