Mondays and Tuesdays are always a little distracted for me.  I get
more work done later in the week and on weekends, typically.

I decided to make some changes to the procedure, mostly in terms of
annotations and filenames - just to make things easier to find.

I keep changing my mind about a script to name atoms uniquely in 
ligand files.  I am undecided whether it will take less time to just
change them by hand or to ....  .....  I have glylib.  This is easy.
I will write code to do it.  Maybe I'll even fix the bug someone 
reported for the c++ compiles of glylib.

I'll assign a short name to each binding site and each ligand.  If there
are multiple ligands, each pose will get a number. 

I'll make one tleap input file and use symbolic links so that it knows
which file to act on.

Each protein/binding site will need a separate set of run control files
so that the relevant parts of the protein can be restrained.
