I have loaded the two files into VMD and will compare them.

Because the two files are in different orders and contain
different information, I had trouble aligning in VMD.

The following selection resulted in the alignment that
convinced me that the proteins were essentially the same.

chain A and resid 7 to 54 56 to 81 83 to 89 91 to 96 98 to 101 103 105 150 to 160 300 to 306

I had also ticked "Backbone" in the VMD trajectory tool.

There is a tail that is very different between the two, so 
I tried the following selection instead (still'Backbone').
In this selection, I have also expanded the alignment selection.

chain A and resid 7 to 54 56 to 81 83 to 89 91 to 96 98 to 101 103 105 150 to 160 250 255 260 265 270 275 280 285 290 295 300

This rendered the structures nearly identical, except 
for the tail as mentioned above.

1:06

That's mostly done now.  See images and VMD visualization 
state files in the VMD directory.

The image 

	Alignment_of_6lu7-and-doamond-6yb7.png

...is a little busy, but contains lots of information.
The PDB file is in blue and the Diamond file is in red.
The backbone is traced with "New Cartoon" using a 
transparent material so that both can be seen.  

The residues that were used to align the structures are shown 
in balls and sticks.  Note that the entire residue is shown but
the alignment was only on the backbone.

The tail that is different between the two (this is not 
surprising or something that troubles me) is highlighted with
a glass-like tube.  

The inhibitor from the PDB structure is shown in solid sticks 
in the binding site.  

The aligned coordinates can be found in the modified PDB 
directory.  

The visualization state and associated file are in the VMD
directory and all begin with 'Alignment_of_6lu7-and-doamond-6yb7'.

(from future:  that should be 'diamond' but not changing it now)

1:22 

Committed and pushed the work so far.  Taking a short break.

1:51

Thought about this during the break, of course.

Next step:  isolate the binding site.

I'm going to use the PDB structure because I have a better 
understanding of how it was generated.  But, from the structural
alignments, it might not matter a lot.  I also prefer the PDB
structuure because it has something in the binding site.

I'll start by finding all the residues near the bound ligand. 
Then, I'll cut off as much of the protein as I can and still 
have an intact strand that contains the binding site.  

I'll do that for both structures, and then compare.

2:18

I've got an image of the binding site with the ligand.  There 
is only one water that looks interesting, so I'll keep it and
let the rest go.  Seeing this in 3D makes a big difference.

The water that looks interesting is resid 416.

Files for this part in the VMD directory start with:

6lu7_binding_region_with_ligand_and_waters

Now to make a couple new PDB files with only these parts.

These files are named:

6lu7_aligned_to_D-6yb7_binding-region.pdb
6lu7_aligned_to_D-6yb7_ligand-and-HOH416.pdb

The VMD files start with:

6lu7_binding_region_with_ligand_and_waters_TRIMMED


2:41

Committed and pushed the work so far.

From previous work, while I was figuring out how to do all
this, I already had made lavandulyl acetate in ChemDraw and
then saved the 3D coordinates. The files are these:

Lavandulyl_acetate.cdxml
'Chem3D XML in Lavandulyl_acetate.mol2'

For whatever reason, ChemDraw doesn't give the molecule
(residue) a name and instead just uses 4 stars.  This is
not useful in more general terms, so I will change it.

This script (in the scripts directory) will convert the
mol2 file to a pdb file and then will change the name
of the residue to something useful

Here's an example of how to use it:

bash ../0_Scripts/convert_checmdraw3D_and_set_residue_name.bash Chem3D\ XML\ in\ Lavandulyl_acetate.mol2 Lavandulyl_acetate.pdb  AAA


This converts Chem3D\ XML\ in\ Lavandulyl_acetate.mol2 to
the PDB format file Lavandulyl_acetate.pdb and then it
changes the name of the residue to AAA.


3:02

I now have the new ligand and the PDB file (with its own
ligand) prepared for use in the virtual reality software.

I will need to transfer the files to the VR headset.

First, though, I'll check the charge on the headset and
warm up my coffee.


3:14

I'm using the SideQuest software to transfer the PDB 
files onto the Oculus Quest that I'm using for the VR.

I had to use SideQuest to install Nanome in the first
place, so it already knows how to contact the Quest.

To make the transfer:

1. I connect the Quest from its USB-C port to the USB-C
port on my laptop.  

2. Make sure the Quest is turned on.

3. I start up SideQuest. On my laptop, it is installed at:

    /home/lachele/Modeling/SideQuest-0.10.2

I cd to that directory and type './sidequest'.

If all goes well, the upper part of the screen looks
like the image in 

    2020-03-27_03-20-28_SideQuest_Success.png

4. I click on the folder icon.  If I hover my mouse 
pointer over the icon, the tooltip says:

"Mange files on the headset"

After I click, I get a list of folders.

    2020-03-27_03-24-25_Top-level-folders.png

5.  Navigate like so, by clicking on the relevant icons:

Android -> data -> com.Nanome.NanomeCurie -> files -> Structure

6.  Then, hover over the '+' lower right and then choose
to "Copy file to this folder" from the menu of icons that
appears above (or open a file browser for drag-and-drop).

I copy these files onto the headset:

    2_PDBs_Modified/6lu7_aligned_to_D-6yb7_binding-region.pdb
    2_PDBs_Modified/6lu7_aligned_to_D-6yb7_ligand-and-HOH416.pdb
    4_ChemDraw_Structures/Lavandulyl_acetate.pdb

See this image for a view when finished:

    2020-03-27_03-32-42_files_transferred.png

6. Now, I put on the headset and start Nanome up.

It's hard to take notes while using the VR headset, so I 
might not do a good job at it. 

Best I can recall:

* As always, save your workspace often.

* I navigated to the "Strucrure" folder and loaded the
  three structures from above.  

  Before loading, I left "Align and Lock" selected.
  If you don't do that, the molecules don't stay in
  their relative places.  

* Then, I chose to make the protein part a surface
  because that makes it easier to see the other 
  molecules.

* I selected the lavendulyl acetate (lav-ace) and 
  unlocked it from the positions of the others.

* Save often... 
 
  Until repositioning the lav-ace, I left the 
  workspace as the default name:

  b.lachele.foley 2020-03-27.nanome

  All subsequent saves got numbers appended.  I'm
  only recording the last one here:

  b.lachele.foley 2020-03-27 (4).nanome

  ...because there isn't a significant difference.

* Then, I moved the lav-ace into the binding site.  
  For this first pose, I chose the simple route and 
  overlaid the acetate part from the lav-ace with an
  ester in the bound ligand from the PDB structure. 
  This doesn't put it far into the binding site, so
  I expect it not to stay, but it might.  

* I then deleted the ligand that came with the 
  structure and combined the lav-ace ligand and
  the protein (necessary to keep their relative
  coordinates after download).  

* I saved the workspace with only the combined
  ligand and protein as:

  lav-ace-1.nanome

  ...where the '1' indicates that I will probably
  try other poses. 

* These are all saved in the Nanome workspaces folder.
  There are also a couple of screen shots from the 
  space.  They are:

  'Nanome - Mar 27 2020 [034611].png' 

        Ligand from PDB file in its binding site.
        The lav-ace residue is not visible.


  'Nanome - Mar 27 2020 [040549].png'

        View from where I had aligned the lav-ace
        with the bound ligand.  


7. Extracting the coordinates requires Windows.  

   * I use Windows in a VM.  Slow.  Very slow for this.

   * First, copy the Nanome workspace of interest to 
     a location where Windows can see it.

     You only need the workspace, not the files used
     as input when building the workspace.

     Here, I copied only lav-ace-1.nanome

  * Inside Windows, move the workspace into the
    Documents folder.

  * Start Nanome on Windows.

  * Navigate to the Documents folder and select the
    workspace to load (here, lav-ace-1.nanome).

  * Once it loads, from the Entry List menu, choose
    the 'export' icon and save the file in your
    favorite format (I choose PDB).  Put it in the
    Documents folder, too.

    You don't get a choice of filename. This one is:

        Lavandulyl_acetate+6lu7_aligned_to_D-6yb7_binding-region.PDB

  * Copy that file back to a space visible to Linux.

    I put this in the Bound Coordinates folder.

8.  Open the file in VMD to make sure everything looks ok.

    The VMD visualization folder has relevant files
    beginning with "lav-ace-1"


4:54 AM

Next, I will need to turn the PDB output from Nanome into
something that can be used as input for a simulation.  But,
first I need sleep.  To be continued.
