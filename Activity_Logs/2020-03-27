I have loaded the two files into VMD and will compare them.

Because the two files are in different orders and contain
different information, I had trouble aligning in VMD.

The following selection resulted in the alignment that
convinced me that the proteins were essentially the same.

chain A and resid 7 to 54 56 to 81 83 to 89 91 to 96 98 to 101 103 105 150 to 160 300 to 306

I had also ticked "Backbone" in the VMD trajectory tool.

There is a tail that is very different between the two, so 
I tried the following selection instead (still'Backbone').
In this selection, I have also expanded the alignment selection.

chain A and resid 7 to 54 56 to 81 83 to 89 91 to 96 98 to 101 103 105 150 to 160 250 255 260 265 270 275 280 285 290 295 300

This rendered the structures nearly identical, except 
for the tail as mentioned above.

That's mostly done now.  See images and VMD visualization 
state files in the VMD directory.

The image

...is a little busy, but contains lots of information.
The PDB file is in blue and the Diamond file is in red.
The backbone is traced with "New Cartoon" using a 
transparent material so that both can be seen.  

The residues that were used to align the structures are shown 
in balls and sticks.  Note that the entire residue is shown but
the alignment was only on the backbone.

The tail that is different between the two (this is not 
surprising or something that troubles me) is highlighted with
a glass-like tube.  

The inhibitor from the PDB structure is shown in solid sticks 
in the binding site.  

The aligned coordinates can be found in the modified PDB 
directory.  

The visualization state and associated file are in the VMD
directory and all begin with 'Alignment_of_6lu7-and-doamond-6yb7'.
