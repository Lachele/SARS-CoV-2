I have loaded the two files into VMD and will compare them.

Because the two files are in different orders and contain
different information, I had trouble aligning in VMD.

The following selection resulted in the alignment that
convinced me that the proteins were essentially the same.

chain A and resid 7 to 54 56 to 81 83 to 89 91 to 96 98 to 101 103 105 150 to 160 300 to 306

I had also ticked "Backbone" in the VMD trajectory tool.

There is a tail that is very different between the two, so 
I tried the following selection instead (still'Backbone').
In this selection, I have also expanded the alignment selection.

chain A and resid 7 to 54 56 to 81 83 to 89 91 to 96 98 to 101 103 105 150 to 160 250 255 260 265 270 275 280 285 290 295 300

This rendered the structures nearly identical, except 
for the tail as mentioned above.

That's mostly done now.  See images and VMD visualization 
state files in the VMD directory.

The image 

	Alignment_of_6lu7-and-doamond-6yb7.png

...is a little busy, but contains lots of information.
The PDB file is in blue and the Diamond file is in red.
The backbone is traced with "New Cartoon" using a 
transparent material so that both can be seen.  

The residues that were used to align the structures are shown 
in balls and sticks.  Note that the entire residue is shown but
the alignment was only on the backbone.

The tail that is different between the two (this is not 
surprising or something that troubles me) is highlighted with
a glass-like tube.  

The inhibitor from the PDB structure is shown in solid sticks 
in the binding site.  

The aligned coordinates can be found in the modified PDB 
directory.  

The visualization state and associated file are in the VMD
directory and all begin with 'Alignment_of_6lu7-and-doamond-6yb7'.

(from future:  that should be 'diamond' but not changing it now)

Committed and pushed the work so far.  Taking a short break.

Thought about this during the break, of course.

Next step:  isolate the binding site.

I'm going to use the PDB structure because I have a better 
understanding of how it was generated.  But, from the structural
alignments, it might not matter a lot.  I also prefer the PDB
structuure because it has something in the binding site.

I'll start by finding all the residues near the bound ligand. 
Then, I'll cut off as much of the protein as I can and still 
have an intact strand that contains the binding site.  

I'll do that for both structures, and then compare.

I've got an image of the binding site with the ligand.  There 
is only one water that looks interesting, so I'll keep it and
let the rest go.  Seeing this in 3D makes a big difference.

The water that looks interesting is resid 416.

Files for this part in the VMD directory start with:

6lu7_binding_region_with_ligand_and_waters

Now to make a couple new PDB files with only these parts.

These files are named:

6lu7_aligned_to_D-6yb7_binding-region.pdb
6lu7_aligned_to_D-6yb7_ligand-and-HOH416.pdb

The VMD files start with:

6lu7_binding_region_with_ligand_and_waters_TRIMMED

Committed and pushed the work so far.

From previous work, while I was figuring out how to do all
this, I already had made lavandulyl acetate in ChemDraw and
then saved the 3D coordinates. The files are these:

Lavandulyl_acetate.cdxml
'Chem3D XML in Lavandulyl_acetate.mol2'

For whatever reason, ChemDraw doesn't give the molecule
(residue) a name and instead just uses 4 stars.  This is
not useful in more general terms, so I will change it.

This script (in the scripts directory) will convert the
mol2 file to a pdb file and then will change the name
of the residue to something useful

Here's an example of how to use it:

bash ../0_Scripts/convert_checmdraw3D_and_set_residue_name.bash Chem3D\ XML\ in\ Lavandulyl_acetate.mol2 Lavandulyl_acetate.pdb  AAA


This converts Chem3D\ XML\ in\ Lavandulyl_acetate.mol2 to
the PDB format file Lavandulyl_acetate.pdb and then it
changes the name of the residue to AAA.
