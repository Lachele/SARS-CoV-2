This directory contains detailed notes about what I've done. 

They are written as I go, so expect mistakes and such.

Because they are in a Git repository, I will make corrections if 
I find mistakes that render the text inaccurate or unreadable.  To
see the original text, you can always go back in the git history.

I work mostly at night, so the dates in the filenames represent 
whatever the date was when I started working.  I might or might
not start a new file if I cross midnight.  I will endeavor to do
so, but no promises.
