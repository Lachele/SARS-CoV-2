I've been making the minimization input files be what I want for the
last hour or so.  Also eating dinner.  The first runs I did used a
very simple minimization strategy, mostly because I was impatient to
see some sort of result but had forgotten entirely how to generate 
a GROUP specification.

Next, I got three minimizations set up and tested them by running
them.  I visualized their trajectories, and they look ok.

Now, I need to decide on an organizational strategy for the runs I
plan to do.  There will be many.  

I could try to get a job running while I do that, but experience 
teaches me that I'll just end up throwing it away because I'm trying
to focus on too much at once.
