Getting a late start.  There were distractions.

The goal for tonight is to repeat the procedure from last night,
except using eucalyptol.  I will follow my notes from last night,
and try to make them into a more formalized workflow.

I choose eucalyptol because (1) I like eucalyptus and (2) I use
it when my head is stuffy and I'm having trouble breathing.  The
latter is a common occurrence because of my allergies.

I definitely want to save a Nanome workspace that contains only 
the binding site and any experimentally bound molecules.  

I'm changing Workflow_Notes to just Workflows.

*** ChemDraw ***

Notes about using ChemDraw.

I have ChemDraw in a Windows 10 virtual machine.  The ChemDraw is licensed
through UGA.  It's version 19.0

When possible, I use Structure > Convert Name to Structure

I always have a heck of a time remembering how to get a 3D structure....

This time, I went to View and clicked on Show Chem3D Hotlink Window

Then, at the bottom left of the window, I clicked on the icon that
declared itself to be able to Launch Chem3D.  That gave me a 3D
view of the structure.  I chose File > Save Copy As and saved it 
as a Mol2 file.

I also saved SMILES for Eucalyptol and went back to get the 
SMILES for the lavandulyl acetate.  



1:56 AM

I've finished all I plan to do with ChemDraw for now.  
I do still need to convert the eucalyptol file.

I also changed the lengthy name of the lavandulyl 
acetate mol2 file to something more reasonable.


2:09 AM

Taking a brief break.  Will probably eat.
