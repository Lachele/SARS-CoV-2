For the last hour and a half, I've been working on the organization of
the information in this repository, on building the organizational
structure (diretories and such) and adding some README docs and such.

My next task is to go all the way through my workflow once and document
the process as I go.  After that, I will go through the process again, 
trying to follow my documented procedure.  I will refine the documentation
as needed.

For my first documentation pass, I will try to insert lavandulyl acetate 
into the binding site of the main protease.  I choose the main protease 
because of the project described within this post:

I choose lavandulyl acetate because (1) I like lavender and (2) it is 
one of the main components in my homemade asthma reliever..
