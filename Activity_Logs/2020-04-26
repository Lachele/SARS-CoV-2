1:33 PM

The last week or so, I've been asleep most times, day and night, when I 
didn't have to be doing something else.  This sometimes happens around
the new moon, occasionally at other times.  Hence, I am nocturnal: no
amount of night-time sleep makes me useful, or even necessarily awake, 
during the day.  About 7 good hours of day-time sleep, and I'm pretty 
productive at night.  It being the weekend, I gave in and just slept as
much as I possibly could.  There is usually no other way.

I'm awake enough now that I remember how to do this again.

Today, I am setting up the first foil for pose1 of the 6lu7 + lavandulyl 
acetate system.  In this foil, which I set up some days or nights ago,
I substituted similarly hybridized carbons for each of the oxygens.  
From observing the simulations, it seemed to me that the 6lu7 binding site
holds tightly onto the acetate part of the molecule.  So, for this first
foil, I'm changing the acetate part to something with a very similar 
geometry, but with very different electronic structure.  Specifically, I 
changed the sp2-hybridized oxygen to a carbon, also with sp2-hybridization 
(C-H2, actually).  Similarly, I replaced the sp3 -O- with -CH2-.

To make the changes, I used the built-in modification capabilities in
Nanome.  I simply changed the two oxygens to carbons.  I then added in
hydrogens as needed.  The hydroxyl already had a carbon, so I only 
needed to add two hydrogens to each newly-made carbon.  

Nanome didn't add numbers to the new C's or H's, so I'll add those into 
the file for use by antechamber, tleap, etc.

So, I numbered the new C and H atoms in the ligand file - I simply
gave them sequentially higher numbers than those that already existed.
I think I will cause myself confusion later if I try to renumber them
in some other way.

$ pwd
/home/lachele/Research/SARS-CoV-2/6_Bound_Coordinates
$ vim 6lu7.lavace.foil.pose1.combined.pdb

Next, I split the Nanome-written file like so:

$ pwd
/home/lachele/Research/SARS-CoV-2/7_MD
$ bash ../0_Scripts/grep_file_parts.bash ../6_Bound_Coordinates/6lu7.lavace.foil.pose1.combined.pdb 6lu7/lav-ace-C-foil/pose1/6lu7-pose1-foil1

Next, I ran antechamber on the ligand to produce a prep file:

$ pwd
/home/lachele/Research/SARS-CoV-2/7_MD/6lu7/lav-ace-C-foil/pose1
$ bash ../../../../0_Scripts/use_antechamber.bash  6lu7-pose1-foil1_ligand



BUT..... it turns out I made one of the C-H bonds just a little too long:

This molecule may have more than one unit.
       antechamber can only handle one unit.  If the input is a single unit
       then the connectivity is wrong and the geometry may be bad.
       Please convert your molecule to a mol2 file via:
       antechamber -j 5 -at sybyl -dr no 
       And then check your molecule with a visualization program;
       manually add missing bonds or delete unwanted bonds as appropriate.



So, I tried adding a CONECT card to let antechamber know that it's ok.

And... now I get a different complaint because I didn't add CONECT cards for
all the bonds.  (all or none, apparently...)


This is why molecular dynamics is so hard most of the time, especially if you
want to do anything even a little unusual.

I'm wondering if it might be faster to just fix that one atom in Nanome.
Probably.  Gonna take a short break and think about it.


9:44 PM

I decided that it would be faster, and possibly better, to fix it in Nanome.
That is done.  Now I get to find out if I fixed it.

Then, to add the atom numbers that Nanome doesn't:

$ pwd
/home/lachele/Research/SARS-CoV-2/7_MD/6lu7/lav-ace-C-foil/pose1
$ vim 6lu7-pose1-foil1_ligand.pdb

Now, to try the minimizations. Maybe they work.

$ pwd

Now, move it to Howard and get the MD going.
