My job has been distracting me a lot.  

Currently, I am preparing for a recording of some of this weok for the folks
at Nanome.  This is good.  It forces me to organize a little.

So far, I learned how to generate a PDB-file trajectory for use in Nanome. 
I would normally not bother to make that sort of trajectory because it takes
up lots more room than the other formats.  But, that's what the device can 
read.  I also write software for this sort of modeling.  I understand.

My task now is to decide what to present.  

At the very least, I should upload work I did early on relevant to the several
PDB files of the main protease with inhibitors.

I should also read the literature that Jim found and organized for me.  :-)
