Yesterday morning, I checked and the lavandulyl acetate had stayed in the
binding site for over 40 ns total (8 x 5+ ns).  

Then, I got to re-reading and thinking and I should really be focusing on
linalool and linalyl acetate because they are bigger components.

Rob asked me if I had thought about negative controls.  I wrote him back
with my thoughts, and, I will start including that info here.  I made a
new 'Validations' directory.  I'll put info about negative controls and
other forms of validations there.  The following is what I said to Rob but
with more detail.  

One form of validation is to see if linalool and/or linalyl acetate bind
to either the hemagglutinin or the neuraminidase from A/Denver/57.  The 
volatile components of lavender essential oil were shown not to inhibit 
these parts of the virion.  So, I could see if either of the two main 
components of lavender EO will stick in their binding sites in my sims.

That study:  http://www.essencejournal.com/pdf/2014/vol2issue1/PartA/8-565.pdf

I found one structure for the hemagglutinin.  It has antibodies bound to
it, so I worry about it being the best structure for this job, but it's 
the only one I can find.  Another study of the neuraminidase produced
several structures.  I'll have to read the paper to figure out which, if
any, of those is right.

Another form of validation / negative control would be to change the chemical
structure a little.  For example, with an acetate or an alcohol, I could 
change the oxygens to be CH3 or CH2 groups, accordingly.  I'm pretty sure 
the acetate is what the protease is latching onto to hold the lavandulyl 
acetate in place, so if I get rid of those oxygens, I expect it to let go.

I can set this latter up more quickly than other, so that's what I'll do
first.  While that's going, I'll read papers about flu.
