I had other work to do for a couple days and only did a little work on this
project.  The git repo has a decent record of what I did.

Summary:

* I started trying to run in a docker container, but when I try to run in 
  parallel, I get error messages for which Google has no hits.  

  More on this below.

* In the process of trying to figure that out, I realized that my restraints
  weren't being set properly (my mistake).  So, I fixed that and restarted 
  the simulations.  So far, so good.

* I implemented a way to deal with large trajectory files separately from 
  the other simulation output.  


About the docker/parallel thing:

I get many errors like this:

	[gw-slurm-amber:00058] Read -1, expected 35472, errno = 1

I ran strace on the process and found that this is output from the wait4
process, which is a process that waits for child processes to complete. 

The run seems to work otherwise.  It just whines constantly while doing it.

I went looking for the problem with parallel runs.  Gave up.  Posted help 
request to the Docker forums.
