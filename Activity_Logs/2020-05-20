I might have mentioned that this is a side-project.  Work became somewhat
demanding the last few weeks, and there has been little spare time.  I am
also behind on papers.  

Anyhow, I plan to merge this work and my job by using this work to design 
an online molecular dynamics service that we've been planning to offer. 

I want to do this because the automation I need for this project was becoming
a little too complex for comfort in BASH.  So, I'll switch to Python and write 
it all into the mmservice gemsModule:

That's the plan anyway.  Wish me luck...  Lol.
