The compound based on lavandulyl acetate, where the oxygens are changed into
corresponding carbons, stayed in the binding site.  It didn't stay in the same
part of the binding site, though, and it seems to move around a lot more.  

What does this mean?  Not sure...

I need to decide what to do next.  I think I should run simulations in water, 
and run simulations for longer. 

The vacuum simulations are slow because they're using sander.  I might try 
using pmemd with the "vacuum like" implicit solvent method and see if the 
results are similar.  If so, I could possibly even us GPU for those.

I think I'll at least get some solvated sims going.

I wrote scripts for solvating minimized complexes and generating top and crd
files for MD input.  

Earlier - before the 12:33 AM entry - I had used ChemDraw to generate linalool
and linalyl acetate files.  This time, I tried generating PDB files.  Rather 
than using stars as the residue name, the pdb-style output uses blanks.  There
must be a way to get better behavior.  In any case, I think I prefer the mol2
version with the stars - at least there is something to search for.

Next up is deciding how best to minimize the solvated structures.  Since they
started with a nicely minimized gas phase structure, it should be ok to simply
minimize the waters and then start the simulation.  But, I'll think on this 
for a little while.
