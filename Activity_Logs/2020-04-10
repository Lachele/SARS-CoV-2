I had to do various tech support - for other folks working on research 
related to covid-19.  So, I didn't do much more with mine today.

I did check the simulations I started yesterday.  They are going well.
The lav-ace has stayed in the binding site for ~2.7 ns in a total of
8 independent simulations (so a little over 20 ns of total time, though
each sim starts from the same structure).

I will need to update my automation scripts, but that's not hard.

The large files will all be available in relevant directories at:

http://glycam.org/files/2020/SARS-CoV-2/VolatilesBinding/

Eventually, that location might move.  It should at least become an
encrypted (https) site.  The GitHub repo should point to the most 
updated location.
