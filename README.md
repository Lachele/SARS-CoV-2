# SARS-CoV-2
Attempts by myself and others to have at least a little impact on the COVID-19 pandemic.

If you want to help, just say. 

If you want to use some of the info, that's fine.   The license is very generous.

## The basic goal

Find common substances that are already widely in use, and generally safe, that might
be effective against SARS-CoV-2.

## An important caveat

**Please don't take the information here as advice to do - or not do - anything.**

## My current approach

This virus is airborne, and it is a respiratory virus.  It is possible to buy disinfectant
spray for surfaces, but you can't inhale it or spray it into your lungs/sinuses/mouth.

But, maybe there are things that we already inhale safely that are damaging to the virus.

It seems unlikely that the perfect substance (or mixture) might be found, but maybe there
is something that will merely slow the virus a little.  Even that is useful.

To that end, the plan is:

* Study relevant binding sites as represented in structures deposited in the 
  wwPDB (https://rcsb.org). 
* Consider volatile components in common herbs, spices and such because these 
  compounds are already inhaled safely by many people.  
* Find among these candidates that might fit into the binding pocket.  If they fit 
  very well, it is possible they might jam up the works, so to speak, for the virus,
  and cause it not to function well.  A compound like this is called an inhibitor.
* Using chemical intuition and the poses of known bound ligands as a guide, place 
  the putative inhibitors into the various binding pockets of SARS-CoV-2.  Although
  it is possible to use docking programs, I'm trying the virtual reality software
  from Nanome (https://nanome.ai).
* Once I get some possible structures, I will run simulations to see if any of the
  compounds stay in any of the binding sites.  Those that stay might possibly
  be inhibitors.

## Some obvious problems

* No matter what natural substance I choose, someone, somewhere, will be sensitive 
  and/or allergic to it.  So, I hope to find a collection of substances.
* The delivery method is not immediately obvious.  Sachet masks?  Scented candles?
  Essential oil diffusers?  Potpourri?  Incense?  
* There is no guarantee that a high enough dose can be put into the air a person breathes
  without endangering the person.  

The big important problem:  Results here might get misused.  Please don't do that.

* Until there have been scientific, controlled studies, any suggestions made here are not
  to be taken as fact. 
* This means that I can't say "use this" because I don't know if any particular thing will 
  help or not. 

**Please don't take the information here as advice to do - or not do - anything.**

I'm trying to help.  Please don't make me regret that.

## Who I am and why I'm doing this

I am not a physician.  I am also not a biochemist, though I have learned a lot of biochemistry 
as a side-effect of my job.  

I am an academic Doctor.  That is, I have a PhD in Chemistry and very significant experience 
in computational chemistry with strong emphasis on glycobiological contexts.

Here's a Google Scholar search on me:  

https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C11&q=b+lachele+foley&oq=

I'm doing this because I can.  The more scientists who do something, the more likely we will 
find something useful.  To not try feels unethical to me.  I don't have high hopes for this 
going anywhere, but it's worth a shot.

## Is there any scientific reason to try at all?

I think so.  My collaborator, Jim, has been collecting scientific studies showing 
anti-viral activity of various essential oil components.  Go look down in the 
Literature folder for more info.

If you go look, you will see that the mechanisms aren't as detailed as would be 
desired by someone doing the work I'm doing.  But, they show that there is a 
possible effect. 

One way to start figuring out the mechanism is just this - put the compounds into
the various parts of the virion and see what happens.  That's what I'm doing, in 
the way that I know how.

## There are others

The main other right now is Jim Grimes, an old friend.  He is helping me find relevant 
literature and information regarding price and availability for the compounds.  

## Funding

This began as a side-project for me and was mostly self-funded.  It's not what I normally
get paid for, though my boss knew I was doing it.  But, recently, the NIH requested that
scientists prioritize COVID-19 research.  So, now it has become my job to do this sort
of thing - and to ensure that others can do their research whenever I can. 

I bought the VR software and headset myself.  I'll still try to run the simulations on my 
laptop, but I will take up unused cores at work when I can.  Others at work are also
working on COVID-19, and my project is less computationally demanding, so they get first dibs.
