	Note that this is NOT PDB ID 6YB7.

## 6lu7.pdb
	PDB ID 6LU7.  Main protease with an inhibitor bound.
	I am dubious about the exact pose, and possibly the 
	exact composition of the bound ligand - there are bad
	overlaps that make the position of one nitrogen seem
	implausible.  But, it is very likely that something 
	goes in that site.
